# Reflection question 1:
Yes?
Main differences:
- Class based component extends react.Component and thereby can contain states by default. Is also sent to DOM automatically.
- Function based components are just regular JavaScript functions which, however, can be manually modified to contain states with hooks and manually be sent to the DOM.

# Reflection question 2:
It is not pure anymore, meaning that updates to this.props and this.state will not be taken into effect.

# Reflection question 3:

Yes, it is possible. If we move the variable to the constructor or if we 
create some kind of subscriber, with an onChange callback ex.

# Reflection question 4:

# Reflection question 5
Yes, onChange is used and therefore the state is updated.

# Reflection question 6:
The value of this is the instanciated component, which state we want to update.

# Reflection question 7:
